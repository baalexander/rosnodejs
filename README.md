Rosnodejs is currently deprecated.

Most of my efforts for JavaScript and robotics has been shifted to the [Robot
Web Tools project](http://robotwebtools.org). I highly recommend taking a look
at Robot Web Tools if interested in putting your robot on the web. Features
include:

 * JavaScript interface to [ROS](http://ros.org) functionality
 * 2D tools for mapping and more
 * 3D tools for robot visualization in a 3D environment

I still feel a Node.js interface into ROS is important. It would complement the
goals of the [nodebots movement](http://nodebots.io/) while harnessing the
awesome power and 1,000+ packages of the Robot Operating System.
